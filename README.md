InnoGames Monitoring Plugins
============================

This repository is only for Nagios compatible scripts developed by
InnoGames.  We have packages for more complicated checks.  This
repository is only for standalone simple scripts which don't worth
having separate packages.  Please don't bloat it.

Style Guide
-----------

The scripts are named with lower-case underscore notation.  The new
ones should have the file prefixes.  The checks should be prefixed
with "check\_".  Not portable ones should include the operating
system they are working on in their names.

License
-------

The scripts are released under the MIT License.  The license is
included on the file headers.  The MIT License is registered with
and approved by the Open Source Initiative [1].
